During our meetings I found time to demonstrate activities to provide insights on strategies or methodologies in data science. Marissa learned from hands on practice of the devops cycle. At the beginning of our mentorship she was getting to know Watson Assistant, NLU and classification models; her tasks were less complex and allowed her to spend time in researching and trialing different techniques. By the end of mentoring she was taking on larger and more complex tasks and since she had the time to learn she was then able to confidently perform tasks.

Apart from client work Marissa and I held conversations about topics in Data Science. I encouraged her to grow her Python skills by demonstrating my work and sharing my code with examples. I also encouraged her to learn about other Watson Services and had shared expertise around Watson Discovery and Knowledge Studio. 

This mentorship helped drive client success since by the end of mentoring Marissa was able to apply what she had learned from our conversations and by practice to take on larger, more complex tasks and the client was able to rely on Marissa for assistance. 

This impacted our client engagement including building client's trust. This helped Marissa become a more informed and well trained data scientist and consultant.
